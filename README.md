# 2-flipflop-synchronizer

**Key Concepts in Synchronization**

**1. Clock Domain Crossing (CDC):**

o CDC refers to the scenario where data or control signals move from one clock 
domain to another. These clock domains can operate at different frequencies or have 
completely unrelated clocks.

o Transferring signals between clock domains without proper synchronization can lead 
to timing errors and metastability. 

**2. Metastability:**

o Metastability occurs when a flip-flop or latch captures a signal that is transitioning 
between logic levels (high or low) at the exact moment the clock edge occurs.

o This can result in an undefined or unstable output, where the flip-flop takes an 
indeterminate amount of time to resolve to a valid logic level. 

o The key goal of synchronization is to reduce the likelihood of metastability affecting 
the system. 

**3. Synchronization Techniques:**

o Various techniques are used to safely transfer data or signals between clock 
domains, preventing metastability and data loss. 

**Two-Flip-Flop Synchronizer (Single-bit Synchronization):**

The simplest and most commonly used method for synchronizing a single-bit signal between 
different clock domains. 

**How it works:**

• A signal from the source clock domain is passed through two flip-flops, both operating in the destination clock domain. 

• The first flip-flop captures the asynchronous signal, and the second flip-flop provides time for the signal to stabilize if it encounters metastability.
